# cs195-game
A game demo for CCSF Class CS195, built by Nat and Jason

There is a run.bat in each of the client, server, and admin_tool folders to compile and run each app from the command line of that folder. If the run.bat doesn't run on your OS, you should still be able to run the command inside each file.

Some of the apps also have an instructions.txt file for additional building and running information.
